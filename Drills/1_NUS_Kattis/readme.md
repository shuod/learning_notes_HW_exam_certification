# NUS Kattis

This is an online judge system used in National university of Singapore. Students use this OJ inline with the course "Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)" (https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs2040.html). This course has a special feature that there is a company website for visualization of each algorithm in the course! Here I record my solution to the problem in that Kattis OJ.
